The need for a detailed weather forecast, especially for weather at sea, was deemed necessary as existing applications did not meet expectations, not only in terms of forecasting successes but also in terms of direction and air intensity, direction and wave height, temperatures, rainfall and other details such as water temperature, cloud coverage and other information important for the day.\nAt Marineforecaster we are always working to improve and add new applications that have been designed to fill in the gaps that existed thereby giving a big boost to the Application.
