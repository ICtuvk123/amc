See all times for that stop by tapping on the info window that appears.\nCLOSE STOPS\n- Select your current location or an address you enter or select on a map as a search location for MTA stops that are nearby.  You can specify a maximum number of stops to return as well as an optional route filter.\nALERTS\n- You can define alerts for when a MTA vehicle is approaching or arriving at a particular stop.
